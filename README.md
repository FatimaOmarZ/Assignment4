***Motivation:***
  - This code was developed and created as part of a course assignment.


***Installation:***
  - This code includes a makefile which is used to compile and test the code.
  - The makefile is made up of multiple commands:
      - CC = gcc
      - CFLAGS = -Wall -g -std=gnu99
      - LDFLAGS = -lrt -lpthread
      - TARGET = Question1  
      - OBJFILES = Question1.o 
      - runq1: the command that compile the the file Question1.c and run it.
